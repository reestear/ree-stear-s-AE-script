# ree-stear-s-AE-script
  
  This script allows you to change the size(not the scale) of all the solid objects in one click and adjust hundreads
and thousands of "Time-Remap" keyframes also in just one click in Adobe After Effects

    //Prehistory of this script:
  
  When I was editing, I had to make several keyframes on the timeline and adjust them in some interval(usually just one)
So, I started to browse the Internet and try to find some existing scripts for my purpose, but I couldn’t find it.
However, in the end, I thought: “if there are no such scripts, I have to make it by myself even if I don’t know anything about AE Scripting”
Finally, I studied  JavaScipt for this purpose and did finish this script in one whole week.
    
    //What does it?:
    
Selects those keyframes that one person wants to adjust and adjusts them in one move
  
Changes the size(not the scale) of "Solid Objects" in percents(%) in one click
  
    // Ui:
    
I am very thankful for NT Productions for providing great videos in UI design
